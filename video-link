In brief:
Step into the wild with our Interactive VR Zoo, a fully immersive experience built in Unity 
that brings learning to life! With stunning 3D models crafted in Blender and textured using 
Photoshop, this virtual zoo lets users explore realistic environments, interact with animals, 
and engage with educational content like never before. Powered by C# scripting and optimized 
for VR headsets, this project transforms traditional learning into an exciting virtual adventure.

Designed especially for students and educators, the VR Zoo makes it easy to visualize complex 
biological and environmental concepts in a fun, engaging way. Whether it's observing animal 
behavior up close or exploring diverse ecosystems, this project turns passive reading into 
active exploration â€” making learning both memorable and magical.
